# RThis Tracking Test

This is a sample code for prove of concepts.

## Installation
- Navigate to the project root directory where the downloaded code is stored, and then run the command: 
npm install
this would install all the dependencies in the node_modules folder

After that, run the command: 
npm run dev
This would launch the client browser and also the backend server both required in order to run the code. 



## Usage
2 Versions can be used from this sample code: both the plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript version that runs
without requiring any server, which has to be built from this code, by running npm run build, and it would 
generate a dist folder that can be run directly in the browser.

The other version would require a server in order to run. Running npm run dev, would run both the front-end and
the backend.
