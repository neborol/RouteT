# RThis Tracking Test

This is a sample code for prove of concepts.

## Installation
- Navigate to the project root directory where the downloaded code is stored, and then run the command: 
npm install
this would install all the dependencies in the node_modules folder

After that, run the command: 
npm run dev
This would launch the client browser and also the backend server both required in order to run the code. 



## Usage
2 Versions can be used from this sample code: both the plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript version that runs
without requiring any server, which has to be built from this code, by running npm run build, and it would 
generate a dist folder that can be run directly in the browser.

The other version would require a server in order to run. Running npm run dev, would run both the front-end and
the backend.

## MORE ABOUT THE APP (DEVABILITY)
- Devability would be an app that would keep track of the developers' ability to think out of the box and be creative, and also keep track of which developer contributes the most reasonable and profitable ideas, that would be used by the company. The app also helps to keep track of which ideas made the client happy the most and also how long did it take the developer to implement those new ideas after the idea had been approved by the manager of innovations.

- In order for Devability to be able to keep track of all these, it should be able to keep track of all the developers, their profile, all their ideas contributed for the year, what developer colleagues shared the workload as directed by the developer who owns the idea, which manager does the developer report to, howmany bug-fixes had to be done before the new innovation got accepted and put into function. 
So in order to properly manage all the above, the app would need to know which developer is currently logged in, and be able to display his profile and his dashboard. That's why Developer registration and Developer (user) login would also be an integral part of this app. 

- Besides the Developers who are building a new idea, other types of users of this app would be the developers' managers (if time permits and if applicable), and above all, the manager in charge of innovations. 

- Each Developer would have his personal dashboard that would show him how he is doing in general according to standards set, and there would be an applications dashboard as well, that shows what progress the whole of the creativity project is making.
